# Media Literacy Insights from PEW Research Center's American Trends Panel: Wave 68 

I am using survey information made available by the PEW research center's American Trends Panel: Wave 68 to seek insights on demographic factors as they relate to media literacy issues. 

## Background

## Data
My dataset comes from the PEW Research Center's American Trends Panel: Wave 68. It consists of 146 columns and 9654 rows. Each row represents a survey respondent. For the purposes of my analysis, I have pulled out 26 rows to examine the data more closely. 15 of those rows are categorized answers to survey questions relating to media coverage of the pandemic. The other ten rows list demographic qualities of respondents. The survey questions I chose to focus on are specifically related to the consumption of news and media literacy. 

More information about the columns I chose to investigate can be found in a seperate .md file in the data directory. 

## Process and Methodology
The survey results are encoded and answers are categorical, rather than truly numeric. Therefore, I used Spearman's Rank Order Correlation to examine relationships between pairs of variables.
